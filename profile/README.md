# 🚀 Stack N9ne  

> *"Nine minds. One stack. Infinite possibilities."*  

Welcome to **Stack N9ne**, the elite crew of 9 developers leveling up through the **MSSA Cloud Application Development Program**.  
We’re a cohort forged in code, fueled by coffee, and driven by the cloud.  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Who We Are  
- **9 Coders** united under one stack.  
- Cloud wranglers, API tamers, and architecture dreamers.  
- Building the future one repo at a time.  

Think *The Fellowship of the Ring* — but with more commits and fewer orcs.  

---

## 🛠️ What We Do  
- **Full-Stack Dev:** From front-end finesse ✨ to back-end muscle 💪.  
- **Cloud Native:** Azure-powered, container-packed, and serverless-ready.  
- **Collaboration:** PRs > Egos. Code reviews > Crunch time.  

If it scales, we’ll deploy it.  
If it breaks, we’ll debug it.  
If it works… we’ll refactor it anyway.  

---

## 🧩 Our Philosophy  
- **Code Clean, Commit Often.**  
- **Break Things, Learn Fast.**  
- **Ship It. Fix It. Improve It.**  

> "Alone we debug, together we deploy."
